        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        “Are you looking to have a website that invokes the nostalgia of the late 90’s and early 2000’s? Do you want a website that screams, “I am very aware of the dangers of the Y2K bug.”? We build modern websites with the look of classic websites to fit your niche needs. We’ve got designs for blog websites; sites designed for the promotion and sale of home brew Nintendo games, sites for stores that specialize in retro video games, and even websites for brick and mortar video stores. With Retro Sites, bring your nostalgia, leave your worries!”

This has to be the page that really grabs the attention of the potential clients. This page will more or less be the one to sell them on the idea. The other pages are meant to be communication or as last throw to convince someone who is on the fence about it. I might even be able to add in some information as to why someone should need a website in the first place. Using google advertising I could probably get web searches for “retro gaming” to filter into the web site. Also posting the web site link into message boards for home brew Nintendo games and emulation would be a good way to boost traffic. 
I’m thinking of having an eight bit loop in the back ground like on older web sites. They were kind of annoying at the time but I also kind of miss how most websites had a “sound track”. Now days I think the common way of doing this is by having videos run. But back then video was not always a very good way to present quality so I do not think that I will be doing that with these web sites. Many retro things are coming back into popularity, and I think that old web site designs will be a fun novelty for some people.

      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <p>
        If I’m able to I might end up putting mockup versions of sample websites next to each testimonial. 
I know quite a few people who design new video games that run on retro hardware. When I continue to learn web design, I could genuinely make a small business out of this idea. 
“Read what our clients have to say about our great websites!” 
“It is certainly a website.” – Jess O
“I like that it is simple enough that my toaster can run this web site.” – Brad B
“Yes.” – Charles A
“It is just like the websites I had in high school.” – Linsey W
A possible idea would be to have the testimonials placed as though they are on a screen from an old tube tv or a old computer monitor. I’m not entirely sure how that would flow with the other pages of the web site but that might have a cool look to it.

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        “Email us at contact@retrosites.co.uk.edu and we will get back to you faster than we would have if we were still using dial up internet.“
On this page I would maybe have a mail chimp or google forms link in addition to just giving out an email address for potential clients to send questions to. I think keeping most of the information on this page at the top would be a good idea, and then fill out the rest of the page with images and colour just for the vibes. This will probably be the most simple of all of the pages, so that the information is gotten across quickly and then the rest just stays in line with the overall theme of the web site. A low quality gif might be fun to put on this page.
